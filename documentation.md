# Dynamic Drum Sequencer

This is a virtual drum machine, with which you can play live drums, as well as create custom sequences of up to 16 sounds.

## Getting Started

### Playing Drums Live

Use the corresponding keys on your keyboard to trigger each drum sample live.

### Using the Sequencer

To put sounds into the sequencer pattern, click on the corresponding field with your mouse, and then select the corresponding drum sample that you would like to input. Once you have a pattern you like, press the "Play" button to play the sequence.
To change the tempo, you can input a BPM into the field manually, or tap the button to set it.
